# Git for Windows

This is the source code of [Git for Windows](http://msysgit.github.io/),
forked from [Git](http://git-scm.com/).

Please note that the Git for Windows project will soon switch to [another
development environment](https://github.com/git-for-windows/) and that the
upcoming Git for Windows 2.* will be maintained
[here](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git).

If you encounter problems, you can report them as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/msysgit/git/issues?direction=desc&sort=updated&state=open), discuss them on Git for Windows' [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/msysgit), and for bigger tasks, hire developers via the mailing list.
